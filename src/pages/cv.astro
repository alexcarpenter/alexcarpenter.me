              “Alex is an excellent teammate and an exceptionally talented web
              developer. When he joined the team we gained an incredibly strong
              collaborator. His thoughtful approach to both producing work and
              actively reviewing code instantly improved the entire teams
              workflow. It is clear that Alex is a life long learner and
              therefore is always sure to bring a new, novel approach to solve a
              problem.”

              Alex is a natural problem solver, and a talented visual designer.
              That combination makes him an excellent front-end engineer. We
              worked together on a new feature with a complex UI and he was able
              to interpret the designs with a care and detail that is rare,
              while also making thoughtful UX suggestions. Not to mention Alex
              is just a great person, easy to talk to and lovely to work with.”
