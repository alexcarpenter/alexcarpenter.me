Yesterday the team launched the beta version of [Clerk Elements](https://clerk.com/docs/elements/overview). You can read about the annoucement on the [changelog](https://clerk.com/changelog/2024-05-02-elements-beta).

> A new set of unstyled UI primitives that make it easy to build completely custom user interfaces on top of Clerk's API.

Incredibly excited to be working on this team and the opportunities this unlocks for folks building custom auth flows. Be sure to checkout the [examples](https://clerk.com/docs/elements/examples/sign-in) and specifically the custom [OTP input](https://clerk.com/docs/elements/examples/primitives) component we put together to showcase how you can make use of Framer Motion to add a bit of delight to your auth experiences.
