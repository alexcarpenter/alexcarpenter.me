I've been consuming a lot of dive watch content recently and came across Benjamin Lowry in one of Teddy Baldassarre's videos and have become a huge fan of his instagram account [submersiblewrist](https://www.instagram.com/submersiblewrist/). He shares a lot of historical dive watch content with some amazing photos from the times.
