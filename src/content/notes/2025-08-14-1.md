Another alternative to `baseline` to ensure the icons within lists are always vertically centered on the first line of text.

```html {3-5}
<ul>
  <li class="flex gap-2">
    <span class="flex h-[1lh] items-center">
      <Icon class="size-[1em] flex-none text-purple-600" name="badge-check" />
    </span>
    List item 2 that is longer than the others and wraps to two lines
  </li>
</ul>
```
