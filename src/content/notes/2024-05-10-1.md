Yesterday we celebrated Micahs first birthday. The weather wasn't super nice, so we kept it simple and went to his favorite restaraunt, which is just an old school dinner where he gets to cheese with all the waitresses and older folks. We header back home and spent the rest of the day playing with his new toys and watching episodes of Zoboomafoo. This weekend will continue celebrating with friends and family.
