TIL you can slow down animations in Chrome DevTools.

Press <kbd>cmd+shift+p</kbd> (or <kbd>ctrl+shift+p</kbd> on Windows/Linux), then search for "animations". An Animations panel will appear at the bottom of DevTools where you can adjust the playback speed to 100%, 25%, or 10%. All animations on the page will now run at the selected speed.
