## Testing

After lots of consideration I finally pulled the trigger on a new keyboard. I was very interested in the Kinesis Advantage360 or the Glove 80, but I have smaller hands and these keyboards require a bit more reach than what feels comfortable to me. So I decided to go with a low profile corne, specifically the Corne 42 LP Keyboard with Kailh Choc Red switches.
