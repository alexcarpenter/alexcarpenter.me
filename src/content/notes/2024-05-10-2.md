Exciting week at work, the team launched the beta release of [Clerk Elements](https://clerk.com/changelog/2024-05-02-elements-beta). I've been lucky enough to spend some time on this team, and work on the component APIs.

I also got to put together a handful of examples that were designed by James, [Sign-in](https://clerk.com/docs/elements/examples/sign-in), [Sign-up](https://clerk.com/docs/elements/examples/sign-up), [Primitives](https://clerk.com/docs/elements/examples/primitives), and [shadcn/ui](https://clerk.com/docs/elements/examples/shadcn-ui).
