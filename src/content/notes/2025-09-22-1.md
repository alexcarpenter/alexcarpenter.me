There was a popular [Tweet shared this weekend](https://x.com/DavidKPiano/status/1969054758318051432/) about using Tailwind CSS child selectors to eliminate repetition.

```tsx
function Table() {
  return (
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td class="px-3 py-2">CSS</td>
        <td class="px-3 py-2">Great</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="px-3 py-2">Tailwind</td>
        <td class="px-3 py-2">Fine</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  );
}
```

There is a time and a place for child selector usage for sure, I am not opposed to them as much as some people are in the threads, but the problem can also be solved by extracting the table data and mapping over it.

```tsx
const data = [
  { name: "CSS", rating: "Great" },
  { name: "Tailwind", rating: "Fine" },
];

function Table() {
  return (
    <table>
      {data.map((item, index) => {
        return (
          <tr key={index}>
            <td class="px-3 py-2">{item.name}</td>
            <td class="px-3 py-2">{item.rating}</td>
          </tr>
        );
      })}
    </table>
  );
}
```

There are many ways to approach the duplication, but I've seen to many people prematurely extract this into a component, when you could simply extract the data for reuse instead.
