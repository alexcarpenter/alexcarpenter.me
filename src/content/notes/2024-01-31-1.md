I've been using [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) for some time now and up until today i've mostly just used it to remap <kbd>caps_lock</kbd> to <kbd>escape</kbd> and make use of vim navigation with <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, and <kbd>l</kbd>.

Today I finally remapped <kbd>right_command</kbd> to <kbd>left_shift</kbd> + <kbd>left_control</kbd> + <kbd>left_option</kbd> + <kbd>left_command</kbd>, and now I have hotkeys setup in Raycast for my most common apps with <kbd>right_command</kbd>. Opens up new layers for optimizations.
