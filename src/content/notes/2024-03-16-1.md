One of the best things I have done for my career is actively review PRs. Taking the time to test and provide valuable (hopefully) feedback on not only the code but also the experience in the browser.

It has also been my biggest learning experience. Seeing how others approach writing code for certain situations. Pulling down the code and commment out certain bits and see it break or function differently. It is always a learning experience.

It has also helped me in my communication. Explaining why you did something a certain way is a very important skill set as you grow your career.

Review code, your co-workers will also thank you for it.
