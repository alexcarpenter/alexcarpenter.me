I've been slowly working on my own shadcn/ui registry while learning more about the whole component distrubution setup at work. So far I have the following components:

- [`<InfoList />`](https://ui.alexcarpenter.me/#info-list)\
  A list component with support for items, headers, and icons slots.
- [`<InlineText />`](https://ui.alexcarpenter.me/#inline-text)\
  An inline text component with an icon slot that wraps perfectly with the text.
- [`<PricingTable />`](https://ui.alexcarpenter.me/#pricing-table)\
  A pricing table component with support for monthly/yearly pricing.
