Been exploring a few different keyboard over the past month.

![Three keyboards on a desk. Nuphy Air 75 at the top, Kinesis Advantage 360 in the middle, and a Corne 42 LP at the bottom.](/img/keyboard-explorations.webp)

It's looking like the 360 will likely be the winner, and will be selling the other two. Still getting use to the layout though...
