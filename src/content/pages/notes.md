2024-01-06
: 6:47 PM - I love discovering cool personal websites. Added a bunch more to my [collection](/personal-websites) tonight.
: 6:38 PM - Switched up the primary font family here to IA Writer Quattro. Feels a bit more readble in usage compared to JetBrains Mono.
: 7:58 AM - Ever since Micah was born, we've always played Bob Marleys top songs on Saturday mornings. It's become a bit of a tradition for us now.

2024-01-05
: 8:33 PM - Friday and in bed by 8:30pm, glorious.
: 5:55 PM - [Damien Jurado](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyVlO8RAg7i0C5h4Wy2QRAw) on repeat today.

2024-01-04
: 8:30 PM - Going down the home automation YouTube rabbit hole once again...
: 12:23 PM - Officially day one at [Clerk](https://clerk.com/), super excited to be joining the team as a UI Engineer working along side [Derek Briggs](https://twitter.com/PixelJanitor), [Joe Bell](https://twitter.com/joebell_) and [Brad Cornes](https://twitter.com/bradlc) on the design team.

2024-01-03
: 6:18 PM - Setting up a new work computer and still happy with my [VS Code settings](https://gist.github.com/alexcarpenter/fc13caa55f02af46b2b83a7ebe29d256) that I had saved for myself previously.
: 5:44 PM - Watched [The Holdovers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14849194/), pretty good, less of a comedy and more on the drama side. Solid 3.5/5 stars.
: 8:16 AM - 36 years old today.

2024-01-02
: 10:25 AM - Slowly transitioning from 1Password to Bitwarden. I can get all of the features I am using with 1Password for free in Bitwarden, and it's open source too.

2023-12-31
: 9:36 AM - Heading into the new year with a sick kid and wife 🫠. Will see if I escape it 🤞🏻. Happy new year!
