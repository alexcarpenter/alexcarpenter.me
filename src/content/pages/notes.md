: 12:23 PM - Officailly day one at [Clerk](https://clerk.com/), super excited to be joining the team as a UI Engineer working along side [Derek Briggs](https://twitter.com/PixelJanitor), [Joe Bell](https://twitter.com/joebell_) and [Brad Cornes](https://twitter.com/bradlc) on the design team.

: 6:18 PM - Setting up a new work computer and still happy with my [VS Code settings](https://gist.github.com/alexcarpenter/fc13caa55f02af46b2b83a7ebe29d256) that I had saved for myself previously.
: 5:44 PM - Watched [The Holdovers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14849194/), pretty good, less of a comedy and more on the drama side. Solid 3.5/5 stars.
: 8:16 AM - 36 years old today.

2024-01-02
: 10:25 AM - Slowly transitioning from 1Password to Bitwarden. I can get all of the features I am using with 1Password for free in Bitwarden, and it's open source too.

2023-12-31
: 9:36 AM - Heading into the new year with a sick kid and wife 🫠. Will see if I escape it 🤞🏻. Happy new year!
