Growing up I worked at my parents feed mill which required me to carry a pocket knife and flashlight. I would need to cut open bags of grain and jump into dark silos frequently. That really was the start of my love for carrying everyday tools. These days my needs for these tools has transitioned to going out to check on the steak on the grill when it is dark or opening packages but I still love carrying and seeking the best tools.
