- Evergoods launched a [new 16L](https://evergoods.us/collections/civic-panel-loader-series/products/civic-panel-loader-16l) version of their ever popular CPL backpack. ~Took everything I had not to pull the trigger on this one.~ JK, pulled the trigger.
- Tactile Turn launched their first flashlight the [Apollo](https://tactileturn.com/products/apollo) in collaboration with CWF Custom Flashlights. Had to pick one up.
- Ricoh has pulled their pre-orders for the GRIIx so I have not been able to find one to purchase unfortunately.
