Dave [asked](https://mastodon.social/@davatron5000/112611154594927376) “What are some things that make your day better?”. Here are some of the things that came to mind for me:

- Pushing Micah around the block in his favorite Step 2 push car
- Pushing Micah on his swing in the front yard
- Weekend coffee shop visits with the family before the farmers market
- Zach Bryan All Night Revival live in concert
- Duck camo
- Titanium
