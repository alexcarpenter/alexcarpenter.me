## <span>Week 32, 2023</span>

### Summary

Overall this week felt great. First full week at Watershed, and I am slowly getting comfortable navigating the codebase. We shipped a hanful of pages and improvements throughout the week.

My stats felt consistent throughout the week, but I really need to figure out a way to increase my step counts. I only averaged 5,604 steps per day. Shooting to be around ~10,000.

We've gotten so used to our 9:30/10 PM bed schedule that the concert on Monday where we didn't get in bed til 12 AM made for a slow Tuesday morning. I've found a consistent sleep schedule to be such an important aspect for a productive and happy week. Especially with a newborn.
