Top 10 Charlie Munger quotes:

1. "Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up."

1. "The best thing a human being can do is to help another human being know more."

1. "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."

1. "In my whole life, I have known no wise people who didn't read all the time — none, zero."

1. "I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don't know the other side's argument better than they do."

1. "The big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting."

1. "You don't have to be brilliant, only a little bit wiser than the other guys, on average, for a long, long time."

1. "The first rule is that you can't really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang 'em back."

1. "There are worse situations than drowning in cash and sitting, sitting, sitting."

1. "The game of life is the game of everlasting learning. At least it is if you want to win."

[Micah](/micah-lee-carpenter) is now 6 months old as of yesterday. It's hard to believe how quickly time is going, but it's been so much fun watching him start to learn new stuff. He's getting close to crawling. Gets his butt in the air on his stomach, but unsure how to move forward. Soon though.
