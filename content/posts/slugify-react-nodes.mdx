I was working on a heading component that accepted either a `string` or a `ReactNode` as `children`. This heading component would then need to use the value provided to children to generate an `id` to be used on itself for use with anchor links.

To do this, I reached for `slugify` from [`@sindresorhus/slugify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sindresorhus/slugify). In the instance a `ReactNode` is used, `slugify` would error because it only accepts a string as an argument. To fix this we can also make use of `onlyText` from [`react-children-utilities`](https://github.com/fernandopasik/react-children-utilities), which as the name implies, extracts only text from ReactNodes.

```tsx
import slugify from '@sindresorhus/slugify';
import { onlyText } from 'react-children-utilities';

interface IHeading {
  as?: 'h1' | 'h2' | 'h3';
  children: string | React.ReactNode;
}

export default function Heading({
  as: Component = 'h1',
  children,
}: IHeading): JSX.Element {
  const id = slugify(onlyText(children));
  return <Component id={id}>{children}</Component>;
}
```
