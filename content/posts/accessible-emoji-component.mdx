I, like a lot of folks these days make heavy use of emoji's in text communication throughout the day. I was about to add an emoji within a new post on this site and remembered that there are some [limitations of how emojis work on the web](https://tink.uk/accessible-emoji/), requiring a bit more work.

Since my blog is built on top of MDX, I built a small React component that takes a `label` and a `symbol` as props and returns markup to be used by screen readers.

Usage:

```jsx
<Emoji label="bacon" symbol="ðŸ¥“" />
```

Which ouputs:

```html
<span role="img" aria-label="bacon">ðŸ¥“</span>
```
