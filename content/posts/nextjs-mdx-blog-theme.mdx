This past weekend I picked apart my personal website setup and config, and extracted that out into a starter template for folks to use as a starting point for their personal website and or blog.

The setup currently includes:

- Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Deployments: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Content: [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Out of the box, it ships with:

- Homepage
- About landing page
- Posts landing page
- Post landing page
- Tagged posts landing page
- Light/dark modes with a theme toggle

I created a very basic theme for those who don't want to do any designing. You can clone and start writing content immediately.
