## [Convert to Tailwind CSS (#112)](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/alexcarpenter-next/pull/112)

After a good amount of time getting familiar with vanilla-extract as the styling solution on this website, i've decided to move back to using Tailwind CSS. I also am now fully converted over to using the app directory too.
