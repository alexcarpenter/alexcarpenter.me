If you've read my [Ice Barrel 400 review](/ice-barrel-400-review), you will have seen some of the challenges i've had using the Ice Barrel in warm Micahigan months. The next logical step was to invest in a chiller unit to avoid needing to constantly purchase ice, and ultimately allow for more frequent cold plunges.

After lots of research, I decided to go with the chiller and barrel bracket from Penguin Chillers. The barrel bracket is made specifically for the Ice Barrel 400 and doesn't require any modifications to the barrel itself, which would have voided the warranty with Ice Barrel.

The chiller and bracket arrived at the estimated 6 week mark.
