text: Alex and I worked together on the design team at NationBuilder. Alex is a natural problem solver, and a talented visual designer. That combination makes him an excellent front-end engineer. We worked together on a new feature with a complex UI and he was able to interpret the designs with a care and detail that is rare, while also making thoughtful UX suggestions. Not to mention Alex is just a great person, easy to talk to and lovely to work with.
